    question: "How long does a placement take?",
    answer:
      "The placement process typically takes 6-12 months from initial application to starting work in Germany. This includes language training in Morocco (4-6 months), document processing and recognition (2-3 months), and visa procedures (1-2 months). We guide you through every step to ensure a smooth transition.",
  },
  {
    question: "What documents are required?",
    answer:
      "You'll need your nursing diploma or certificate, official transcripts, valid passport, birth certificate, police clearance certificate, and health certificates. All documents must be officially translated into German. We provide a detailed checklist and help you prepare all necessary paperwork.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the recognition process work?",
    answer:
      "The recognition process involves submitting your nursing qualifications to German authorities for evaluation. We handle the entire process: document preparation, translation, submission to the relevant recognition body, and follow-up. If additional training is required, we arrange that as well.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who covers which costs?",
    answer:
      "AmalCare covers the costs of language training, recognition procedures, and placement services. You're responsible for personal documents (passport, certificates) and visa fees. Once employed, your German employer covers relocation costs and provides competitive salary from day one.",
  },
  {
    question: "How exactly does the cooperative model work?",
    answer:
      "Our cooperative model means we work together as partners. We invest in your training and preparation, while you commit to working with our partner healthcare facilities in Germany. This ensures quality training, guaranteed placement, and long-term career support for your success.",
